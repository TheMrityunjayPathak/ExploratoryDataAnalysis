Hello Everyone,👋
Here is my Exploratory Data Analysis Project on IRIS Dataset where I analyzed the Data by using Graphs,Charts and Some Pandas Functions.

❓ **What is EDA?**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach that is used to analyze the data and discover trends, patterns, or check assumptions in data with the help of statistical summaries and graphical representations. 

👉 **Types of EDA**

Depending on the number of columns we are analyzing we can divide EDA into three types.

1️⃣ **Univariate Analysis** – In univariate analysis, we analyze or deal with only one variable at a time. The analysis of univariate data is thus the simplest form of analysis since the information deals with only one quantity that changes. It does not deal with causes or relationships and the main purpose of the analysis is to describe the data and find patterns that exist within it.

2️⃣ **Bi-Variate analysis** – This type of data involves two different variables. The analysis of this type of data deals with causes and relationships and the analysis is done to find out the relationship between the two variables.

3️⃣ **Multivariate Analysis**  – When the data involves three or more variables, it is categorized under multivariate
