**Exploratory Data Analysis**

Hello Everyone, 👋

Here is My EDA Project on IRIS Dataset where I analyzed the Data by using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

------------------------

❓ **About the Dataset**

🔹 This Dataset consists of 3 different types of Iris Flower (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica).

🔹 The information includes its Petal Lenght, Sepal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Width, Variety of the Flower.

-----------------------------

🌐 **Setting up the Enviroment**

Jupyter Notebook is required for this project and you can install and set it up in the terminal.

> Install the Notebook - `pip install notebook`

> Run the Notebook - `jupyter notebook`

------------------------------------------

🗃️ **Libraries required for the Project**

🔸 **Pandas**

> Go to Terminal and run this code - `pip install pandas`

> Go to Jupyter Notebook and run this code from a cell - `!pip install pandas`

🔸 **Matplotlib**

> Go to Terminal and run this code - `pip install matplotlib`

> Go to Jupyter Notebook and run this code from a cell - `!pip install matplotlib`

🔸 **Seaborn**

> Go to Terminal and run this code - `pip install seaborn`

> Go to Jupyter Notebook and run this code from a cell - `!pip install seaborn`

📝 **Steps involved in the Project**

1️⃣ **Importing libraries required for Project**

2️⃣ **Reading CSV File**

3️⃣ **Exploring the Dataset**

4️⃣ **Checking Null Values in Dataset**

5️⃣ **Splitting the Dataset based on Species of Flower**

6️⃣ **Data Visualization**

📍 **Count Plot on IRIS Dataset**

🔹 A Count Plot is similar to a Bar Plot and a Histogram and provides counts of categorical values.

🎯 **Scatter Plot on IRIS Dataset**

🔹 Scatter plots are the graphs that present the relationship between two variables in a data-set.

⌛ **Pair Plot on IRIS Dataset**

🔹To Plot Multiple Pairwise Bivariate Distributions in a Dataset, you can use the sns.pairplot() function.

📈 **Distribution of Sepal Length and Petal Length of Different Species of Flower**

🔹 Distribution plots show how a variable (or multiple variables) is distributed.

🔹 To Plot distribution plots you can use the sns.displot() function.

📊 **Box Plot on IRIS Dataset**

🔹 A box and whisker plot also called a box plot displays the five-number summary of a set of data. 

🔹 The five-number summary is the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.

⚡ **Heat Map on IRIS Dataset**

🔹 Heat Map is used to find out the Correlation between different features in the Dataset. 

🔹 High Positive or Negative value shows that the features have high Correlation.

🔹 A Correlation Heatmap is a graphical tool that displays the correlation between multiple variables as a color-coded matrix.
