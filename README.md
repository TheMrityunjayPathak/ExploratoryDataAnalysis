**Exploratory Data Analysis**

Hello Everyone, 👋

Here is My EDA Project on IRIS Dataset where I analyzed the Data by using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

❔ **About the Dataset**

This Dataset consists of 3 different types of Iris Flower (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) information including its Petal Lenght, Sepal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Width, Variety of the Flower.

📍 **Link to the Dataset :** [Iris Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html)

📝 **Steps involved in the Project**

1️⃣ **Importing libraries required for Project**

2️⃣ **Reading CSV File**

3️⃣ **Exploring the Dataset**

4️⃣ **Checking Null Values in Dataset**

5️⃣ **Splitting Dataset based on Species of Flower**

6️⃣ **Data Visualization**

- Count Plot on IRIS Dataset

📌A Count Plot is similar to a Bar Plot and a Histogram and provides counts of categorical values.

- Scatter Plot on IRIS Dataset

📌Scatter plots are the graphs that present the relationship between two variables in a data-set.

- Pair Plot on IRIS Dataset

📌To Plot Multiple Pairwise Bivariate Distributions in a Dataset, you can use the sns.pairplot() function.

- Distribution of Sepal Length and Petal Length of Different Species of Flower

📌Distribution plots show how a variable (or multiple variables) is distributed.To Plot distribution plots you can use the sns.displot() function.

- Box Plot on IRIS Dataset

📌A box and whisker plot—also called a box plot—displays the five-number summary of a set of data. 

📌The five-number summary is the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.

- Heat Map on IRIS Dataset

📌Heat Map is used to find out the Correlation between different features in the Dataset. 

📌High Positive or Negative value shows that the features have high Correlation.

📌A Correlation Heatmap is a graphical tool that displays the correlation between multiple variables as a color-coded matrix.
